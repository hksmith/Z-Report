# Z-Report
A class project that i did 1 year ago 
What this project does is it generate a z-report for those of you who doesn't know what z report is ( https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/what-is-a-z-report-for-restaurants#:~:text=In%20restaurants%2C%20the%20Z-Report,a%20fresh%20set%20of%20zeroes. ) viste this site.

When i describe what my project real do in detail is when sellers do there selling and at the end of the day when they want to auditee their day or in other word when they want to generate z-report this project come in handy.
It accepts from the user how many products did it sell, so based on that it will ask repetative question for each product like how much do you buy it and how much do you sell it and how much do have now and was at the beginng of the day, and then it will tell to the user how mcuh profit it get, how much total money s/he makes and if he wants it can calculate it taxes. It saves the final result of the report in the same path as the excutable fiel found in tabular form with it's current time so when the user do another z-report it will found it's history in it.
